1. Combination of which 2 items will increase the sales on a regular basis?

Workforce and Price Reductions
A company that specializes in attracting and maintaining talented employees is focused on increasing  the sales on a regular basis and its market percentage. That’s because skilled employees can become educated employees.These helps us in reducing the expenses on hiring and training. Also a skilled group of workers that excels at its tasks can permit a comapny to hold its consciousness on generating outstanding products and sales. Attracting the best requires competitive salaries and a strong selection of benefits, including options for flexible work schedules and comfortable office settings.Lowering prices is a solid strategy to help a company to increase sales everyday.Lowering prices can attract consumer attention and loyalty. That can boost the all-critical income nad can that drive market share higher. In addition to decreasing the actual price for products, a company can consider promotions, coupons, bonus items, and other customer benefits. For instance, incentives such as referral programs and free shipping can generate extra interest and added sales.

2. At what time of the day are the sales most influential?

According to my observation ,starting from 9 am to 6 pm, early morning (8-9 a.m.) and late afternoon (4 - 5 p.m.) in would be the best time to make a sales. The second best time to make a sales call would be in the morning between 10 am to 11 am.As the people in the early hours would be active and interested to buy the products we need to push them towards there interest by using skilled employees.


3. If you had to replace an item from the servings, which would it be and why?

If you had to replace an item from the servings,it would be onions and cucumber from the regular salad instead of that I prefer Celery and Carrots. Actually there is no necessary of replacing the items if that was preferred but just in case i would replace them.

4. If you had to add wine to one particular hour of the day, at what time would it be?

Researchers have officially determined when wine o' clock begins and it's very specific: 6.59pm.And also drinking wine before bed is great for a healthy weight loss, but at the same time helps in inducing sleep and is great for a healthy skin.Mainly drinking red wine at evenings is considered for good and glowing skin. So dinner hour is the best time to add wine
